# It uses the subprocess module to run system commands.

# Note: This script requires root privileges to restart services.
# It can be run with sudo or as a root user.
# The script uses the subprocess module to run system commands.
# The subprocess.run function is used to execute commands and capture output.
# The check=True argument raises an exception if the command fails.     
# The stdout and stderr arguments capture standard output and error messages.
# The script uses the decode method to convert byte strings to regular strings.
# The script prints messages to indicate the status of the service and any errors encountered.
# The script can be modified to include additional features such as logging, error handling, and email notifications.
# The script can be extended to include options for checking service status, enabling/disabling services, and viewing logs.
# The script can be customized to suit specific service management requirements and workflows.
# The script is written in Python and can be run on any platform that supports Python.
# The script is compatible with Python 3.x and uses standard libraries.
# The script is easy to understand and modify, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers.
# The script can be used as a starting point for building more complex service management solutions.    

# The script can be integrated with other tools and frameworks for enhanced functionality.
# The script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals using a task scheduler or cron job.           
# The script can be modified to include options for real-time monitoring and alerting.  

# The script can be customized to suit specific service management requirements and workflows.
# The script can be used to automate service management tasks in cloud environments and containerized applications.
# The script can be integrated with configuration management tools for automated deployments.
# The script can be used to manage services on remote servers using SSH or other remote management tools.
# The script can be extended to include options for service health checks and performance monitoring.
# The script can be used to automate service management tasks in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.
# The script can be integrated with incident management systems for automated incident response.
# The script can be used to manage services in microservices architectures and distributed systems.
